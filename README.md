# Kaggle-Diabetes-Dataset
Final Project for the Unsupervised Learning Course - Part of the Machine Learning for Modeling Course in the Artificial Intelligence for Science and Technology Master's Degree. Our goal is to predict diabetes using the provided dataset. This project was done in collaboration with Antonio Balordi.
## Goal of the project
The project goals were as follows:

- In the initial phase, perform data preprocessing.
- Implement various clustering algorithms: K-prototype, K-mode, Hierarchical Clustering.
- Evaluate the algorithms using both supervised and unsupervised metrics.
- Implement the Shapley Value.
